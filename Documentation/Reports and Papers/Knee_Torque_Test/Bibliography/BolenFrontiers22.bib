	abstract = {This work demonstrates an algorithm that is able to compute optimal placement for braided pneumatic actuators on a bipedal robot in order to emulate the biology of human legs. The algorithm calculates the torque that muscles are able to generate about a series of joints (back, hip, knee, ankle, subtalar, and metatarsophalangeal) in a human model. It then compares these torques to the torque that is achievable by a reduced number of pneumatic muscles actuating a bipedal robot model and optimizes the results to reduce the error between the robot and human model. The algorithm successfully ﬁnds new muscle placements that will be used in physical testing to verify that the torque output is correct and matches similarly to human capabilities. The algorithm was performed for three muscles about the back (lumbrosacral) joint: erector spinae, internal oblique, and external oblique. It generates placements capable of producing torque proﬁles that are more biologically realistic than the previously hand placed locations. Currently, the algorithm is not prevented from placing muscle paths that intersect the physical structure. This work will enable the development of controllable, physical models that more accurately capture force and torque capabilities of human muscles. Such physical models will enable more complete testing of how the nervous system performs eﬀective control of over-actuated muscle systems, and if such systems have advantages for robotic applications.},

	abstract = {In musculoskeletal modeling, reliable estimates of muscle moment arms are an important step in accurately predicting muscle forces and joint moments. The degree of agreement between the two common methods of calculating moment arms—tendon excursion (TE) and geometric origin–insertion, is currently unknown for the muscles crossing the knee joint. Further, measured moment arm data are subject to variability in estimation of attachment sites as points from irregular surfaces on the bones, and due to differences in joint kinematics observed in vivo. Thus, the objectives of the present study were to compare moment arms of major muscles crossing the knee joint obtained from TE and geometric methods using a finite element-based lower extremity model, and to quantify the effects of potential muscle origin–insertion and tibiofemoral kinematic variability on the predicted moment arms using probabilistic methods. A semiconstrained, fixed bearing, posterior cruciate-retaining total knee arthroplasty was included due to available in vivo kinematic data. In this study, muscle origin and insertion locations and kinematic variables were represented as normal distributions with standard deviations of 5 mm for origin–insertion locations and up to 1.6 mm and 3.0° for the kinematic parameters. Agreement between the deterministic moment arm calculations from the two methods was excellent for the flexors, while differences in trends and magnitudes were observed for the extensor muscles. Model-predicted deterministic moment arms from both methods agreed reasonably with the experimental values from available literature. The uncertainty in input parameters resulted in substantial variability in predicted moment arms, with the size of 1–99\% confidence interval being up to 41.3 and 35.8 mm for the TE and geometric methods, respectively. The sizeable range of moment arm predictions and associated excursions has the potential to affect a muscle’s operating range on the force–length curve, thus affecting joint moments. In this study, moment arm predictions were more dependent on muscle origin–insertion locations than the kinematic variables. The important parameters from the TE method were the origin and insertion locations in the sagittal plane, while the insertion location in the sagittal plane was the dominant parameter using the geometric method.},

Nominal values for these biomechanical parameters were established using a public-domain musculoskeletal model of the lower limb (IEEE Trans. Biomed. Eng. 37 (1990) 757). To fit these nominal values, regression equations with different levels of complexity were generated, based on the number of generalized coordinates of the joints spanned by each musculotendon actuator. Least squares fitting was used to identify regression equation coefficients. The goodness of the fit and confidence intervals were assessed, and the best fitting equations selected.},

	abstract = {Biomechanics researchers often use multibody models to represent biological systems. However, the mapping from biology to mechanics and back can be problematic. OpenSim is a popular open source tool used for this purpose, mapping between biological specifications and an underlying generalized coordinate multibody system called Simbody. One quantity of interest to biomechanical researchers and clinicians is “muscle moment arm,” a measure of the effectiveness of a muscle at contributing to a particular motion over a range of configurations. OpenSim can automatically calculate these quantities for any muscle once a model has been built. For simple cases, this calculation is the same as the conventional moment arm calculation in mechanical engineering. But a muscle may span several joints (e.g., wrist, neck, back) and may follow a convoluted path over various curved surfaces. A biological joint may require several bodies or even a mechanism to accurately represent in the multibody model (e.g., knee, shoulder). In these situations we need a careful definition of muscle moment arm that is analogous to the mechanical engineering concept, yet generalized to be of use to biomedical researchers. Here we present some biomechanical modeling challenges and how they are resolved in OpenSim and Simbody to yield biologically meaningful muscle moment arms.},

The purpose of this robot is to achieve motions and characteristics that are very similar to a human body.

Using a bundle of thin McKibben muscles, we develop a multifilament muscle that has characteristics similar to those of human muscles. In contrast, the actuators of conventional musculoskeletal robots are very heavy, not densely attached and have poor backdrivability. Because multifilament muscles are light and can be densely attached, we can attach them to the musculoskeletal robot as skeletal muscle and achieve a redundant system that is equivalent to a human drive mechanism. In this paper, we report a method for fabricating multifilament muscles that imitate various muscles, the development of a lower-limb muscle mechanism for the redundant musculoskeletal robot with thin McKibben muscles and experimental results showing that the proposed musculoskeletal robot achieves humanlike motions that have not yet been reported for other robots.},

Scientists have identified the pathways of reflexes; however, it is difficult to investigate their effects during locomotion because locomotion is controlled by a complex neural system and current technology does not allow us to change the control pathways in living humans. To understand these effects, we construct a musculoskeletal bipedal robot, which has similar body structure and dynamics to those of a human. By conducting experiments on this robot, we investigate the effects of reflexes (stretch reflex and crossed inhibitory response) on posture during hopping, a simple and representative bouncing gait with complex dynamics. Through over 300 hopping trials, we confirm that both the stretch reflex and crossed response can contribute to reducing the lateral inclination during hopping. These reflexive pathways do not use any prior knowledge of the dynamic information of the body such as its inclination. Beyond improving the understanding of the human neural system, this study provides roboticists with biomimetic ideas for robot locomotion control.},

	abstract = {In a musculoskeletal system, internal tensile forces are generated among the muscles because it is a redundant system. The balancing of the internal tensile forces for a given posture generates a potential field in the system. Therefore, the potential field is utilized for the sensorless feedforward position control and improvement of stability based on the feedback method. However, the stability of the internal tensile forces is strongly influenced by the muscular arrangement. Previous studies showed that a stable condition can be identified through the minimization of the potential at a desired posture, and the sufficient condition has been theoretically established; however, the geometric condition of the muscular arrangement has not been determined. To effectively exploit the characteristics of the internal tensile forces, the geometric condition must be elucidated in the design of a musculoskeletal system. This paper aims to clarify the geometric condition to generate stable internal tensile forces. Based on the conditions generating the potential that is minimum at the desired posture, the paper analyzes that the geometric condition on a musculoskeletal structure with two-link and six-muscle. Additionally, the identified condition is assessed based on simulations. As a result, we revealed the geometric condition of the muscular arrangement to generate stable internal tensile forces. By designing the muscular arrangement to satisfy the condition, the stability of the internal tensile forces is ensured, and consequently, a control method utilizing the characteristics of the internal tensile force is stably implemented.},

Artificial muscles or actuators refer to intelligent stimuli-responsive materials that could reversibly deform with the trigger of various external stimuli. These materials, which have attracted tremendous attention, produce natural muscle-like actuation performance and show promising applications in robotics. After an introduction of various actuator technologies that contribute to robotic applications, a comparative analysis of the main actuation parameter is provided. The comprehensive comparisons of each kind of artificial muscle are summarised, and the promising properties that are required in robotics are presented, which highlight the development of their actuation performances and the challenges that limit their further employments.

As a musculoskeletal system naturally possesses superiorities of flexibility and robustness, realizing human-like manipulation with the musculoskeletal system is investigated in this paper. However, the redundancy, coupling and strong nonlinearity of musculoskeletal system will bring many challenges for control. Therefore, based on strategies of human manipulation and muscle coordination, a biologically inspired control scheme is proposed. First, we apply a strategy based on attractive region in environment to plan the manipulation under environmental constraints in the task space. Then, we extract muscle synergies as movement primitives and design an iterative learning controller to coordinate these synergies to accomplish complex manipulation. The muscle synergy based iterative learning controller can overcome the difficulty of constructing an explicit model of the sophisticated musculoskeletal system and improve motion learning by transforming the high dimensional muscle excitation into a lower dimensional space. With the combination of strategy based on attractive region in environment and muscle synergy based controller, we preliminarily realize human-like manipulation with high precision, flexibility and robustness. The effectiveness of our control scheme is verified in a peg-in-hole assembly task.},

	abstract = {As a strategy to address the difﬁculties encountered when modeling and controlling a musculoskeletal system, we present a straightforward implementation of an autonomous decentralized motion control system in this paper; the system is inspired by the spinal reﬂex system of animals. We developed an artiﬁcial receptor, a muscle, and a neuron to mechanically implement the reﬂex mechanisms of animals. Among the reﬂex mechanisms, this paper presents a reﬂex system with reciprocal innervation for a musculoskeletal quasi-quadruped robot, including antagonist muscles. In the experiments, the robot autonomously generated a leg trajectory and a gait pattern with smooth alternating motions of the antagonist muscles through the interaction between the body, the ground, and the artiﬁcial reﬂex systems. To evaluate the reciprocal innervation, we compared the developed robot with one that does not include antagonist muscles. The reciprocal innervation allows for twice as many muscle implementations as those offered by the robot without antagonist muscles. Moreover, it improves the running speed by 5\% on average and the ﬂexion and extension velocities of all joints by 28\% on average at around touchdowns and liftoffs of the foot. This successful result lead to implement more advanced nervous systems by solely mechanical devices.},

	url = {https://asme.pinetec.com/detc2017/data/pdfs/trk-8/DETC2017-67458.pdf},
	abstract = {Braided pneumatic actuators (BPAs) are attractive for use in
bio-robots because they offer many muscle-like properties,
especially when compared to most other commercially available
robotic actuators. Unfortunately, the same properties that make
these actuators similar to muscles make them more difficult to
control. One such actuator manufactured by Festo, the MXAM-
10-AA, is frequently utilized in robotics because of its
commercial availability, durability, and force capability.
Although models for BPAs exist, the properties that make this
actuator more durable also make its behavior less like other
braided pneumatic actuators, especially for shorter actuator
lengths. Length specific models that do exist for Festo fluidic
muscles have numerous parameters that can only be found
experimentally by taking hundreds to thousands of data points
and performing a lengthy optimization process to fit parameter
values for each actuator in the system. This lack of
generalizability makes it difficult to build a new robot and begin
testing new control systems without significant startup time and
cost. The key contribution of this work is the development of a
generalizable actuator model that accounts for the geometry and
limitations of the actuator at shorter lengths. This empirical
model relates internal pressure, strain, stretching or contracting
state, and applied force on the MXAM-10-AA actuator. The
model is scalable to different length actuators by measuring their
resting length at zero pressure and their minimum contraction
length at maximum air pressure, and can be used for feedforward
length control. The model is evaluated on a robot leg with three
joints and 6 actuators, each with different length. The developed
controller, using the actuator model, controls the joints to within
± 3 degrees of the desired position for different desired torques
only using internal actuator pressure feedback. We also
demonstrate control speed by cycling a joint over 40 degrees of
rotation at varying frequencies.},

	abstract = {Bipedal robotic leg kinematics and dynamics are a key component in designing biomimetic humanoid robots. This work describes the process of designing artificial muscle attachment locations of the legs of a bipedal robot utilizing pneumatic artificial muscles (PAMs). PAMs offer similar force and activation times to real muscles, while being lightweight and low power. However, not all properties are identical, and substituting artificial muscles in with the same attachment locations results in different torque profiles about each joint. This work analyzes muscle length, moment arm, and isometric force of muscles over a range of different joint configurations, based on muscle attachment and wrapping points of the Gait2392 model in OpenSim. These parameters are then used to find joint torques produced by each muscle. This process is repeated for a model of the robot actuated by PAMs. Joint torques for individual muscles and groups of muscles are then compared between the models. Results indicate that several muscles torque profiles in the robot model closely match that of the human model, however, many muscles fall far short of the human capabilities. Where appropriate, additional results demonstrate how muscle attachment locations on the robot have been modified to better match the torque capabilities demonstrated by the OpenSim model. Matlab tools created for this project will facilitate further design refinement before implementation on the robot.},

	abstract = {A simple planar static model of the knee joint was developed to calculate effective moment arms for the quadriceps muscle. A pathway for the instantaneous center of rotation was chosen that gives realstic orientations of the femur relative to the tibia. Using the model, nonlinear force and moment equilibrium equations were solved at one degree increments for knee flexion angles from 0 (full extension) to 90°, yielding patellar orientation, patellofemoral contact force and patellar ligament force and direction with respect to both the tibial insertion point and the tibiofemoral contact point. The computer-derived results from this two-dimensional model agree with results from more complex models developed previously from experimentally obtained data. Due to our model's simplicity, however, the operation of the patellar mechanism as a lever as well as a spacer is clearly illustrated. Specifically, the thickness of the patella was found to increase the effective moment arm significantly only at flexions below 35° even though the actual moment arm exhibited an increase throughout the flexion range. Lengthening either the patella or the patellar ligament altered the force transmitted from the quadriceps to the patellar ligament, significantly increasing the effective moment arm at flexions greater than 25°. We conclude that the levering action of the patella is an essential mechanism of knee joint operation at moderate to high flexion angles.},

	abstract = {The generation of muscle-actuated simulations that accurately represent the movement of old adults requires a model that accounts for changes in muscle properties that occur with aging. An objective of this study was to adjust the parameters of Hill-type musculo-tendon models to reflect nominal age-related changes in muscle mechanics that have been reported in the literature. A second objective was to determine whether using the parametric adjustments resulted in simulated dynamic ankle torque behavior similar to that seen in healthy old adults. The primary parameter adjustment involved decreasing maximum isometric muscle forces to account for the loss of muscle mass and specific strength with age. A review of the literature suggested the need for other modest adjustments that account for prolonged muscular deactivation, a reduction in maximum contraction velocity, greater passive muscle stiffness and increased normalized force capacity during lengthening contractions. With age-related changes incorporated, a musculo-tendon model was used to simulate isometric and isokinetic contractions of ankle plantarflexor and dorsiflexor muscles. The model predicted that ankle plantarflexion power output during 120 deg/s shortening contractions would be over 40\% lower in old adults compared to healthy young adults. These power losses with age exceed the 30\% loss in isometric strength assumed in the model but are comparable to 39–44\% reductions in ankle power outputs measured in healthy old adults of approximately 70 years of age. Thus, accounting for age-related changes in muscle properties, other than decreased maximum isometric force, may be particularly important when simulating movements that require substantial power development.},

The robotic joint presented mimics the design of the human knee joint by copying the condylar surfaces of the femur and tibia. The joint significantly reduces the complexity, while preserving the mechanisms of the human knee’s motion, and the torque requirements. This joint offers the remarkable feature of being multifunctional since it separates structural and kinematic functions namely integration of (i) high level of shock absorption due to its dynamic variation of pressure between the articular surfaces and its curved profile and (ii) high mechanical advantage due to its moving center of rotation. These functions are essential for humanoid robotic limbs where performance improvement is requisite. The design demonstrates the possibility to simplify the knee linkage arrangement while still providing a moving center of rotation by dynamically changing the pressure between the joint surfaces (femur and tibia). This dynamically controlled pressure enables accurate joint movement by mimicking the human knee property of the same feature. A prototype of the joint has been developed for testing the beneficial properties designed into the model.},

This tecnique allow to reduce the computational cost in a great way, optimizing problems where the rotation center has to be calculated many times. To achieve this goal, the problem is described and formulated in a robust way using natural coordinates and operating within the body of complex numbers. Then, to deal with the present problem, the mechanism's kinematics position in natural coordinates is modeled and computing and with the obtained equations, a program is implemented in MATLAB® to show the curve described by the rotation centers of links, which is fundamental for the optimal design of polycentric mechanisms.},

	abstract = {This paper presents a general classification method for determining the functional role of any muscle, and a procedure for determining the sensitivity of that role to small changes in system parameters. The classification method is based on the premise that the system model, when acted upon solely by the muscle of interest, will depart from any initial rest configuration in such a way as to decrease the muscle’s length. This method is particularly useful for multiple-joint muscles, and is illustrated by examining a slider-crank mechanism and straight line muscle model to determine the functional role of the hamstrings during a constrained leg flexion motion.},

	abstract = {The purpose of this dissertation is to explore the feasibility of utilizing functional neuromuscular stimulation (FNS) to effect a “functional stance” in paraplegics. In this context, a functional stance is defined as an upright standing posture that can be maintained in the presence of large and unexpected postural perturbations by executing an appropriate compensatory step. In its present state of development, it is not entirely clear whether FNS can enable this type of postural recovery strategy. This uncertainty is further clouded by the fact that the biomechanical demands of compensatory stepping have not been studied in detail.
This investigation is based on a dual track of experimentation and computer modeling. In the experimental phase, the compensatory stepping responses of able-bodied individuals to forward, waist-level perturbations of stance were measured. Biomechanical demands of the movement were quantified, and analysis was conducted to identify the biomechanical features of the response. In the modeling phase, optimization and a dynamic musculoskeletal model were utilized to explore the feasibility of utilizing FNS to effect similar, single-step compensatory movements in paraplegics. Both phases relied upon dynamic modeling to quantify the response dynamics. A whole-body, 3-dimensional, forward dynamic musculoskeletal model was developed specifically for this project, and validated through an independent study of human gait.
The results indicate that able-bodied individuals execute stepping motions in a feed-forward, ballistic manner. Responses were initiated rapidly, and often well before the theoretical limits of stability were reached. The motion of the step foot appears to have been carefully controlled, and net foot displacement was strongly related to the mechanical conditions evident at foot contact. The joint torques and muscle forces associated with compensatory stepping were nominally modest, but still exceeded the hip abduction and ankle plantarflexion capabilities reported in paraplegics. In addition, the necessary rates of torque and muscle force development were high given those typically available in paraplegics following muscle conditioning. Dynamic analysis indicates that similar stepping motions could be executed by paraplegics standing via FNS, but only if: (i) disturbances can be sensed early, (ii) controls can be computed quickly, (iii) a large set of muscles is stimulated, and (iv) muscles can be reconditioned to near normal strength and contract at near normal rates.},

	abstract = {Muscle paths in musculoskeletal models have been modeled using several different methods; however, deformation of soft tissue with changes in posture is rarely accounted for, and often only the neutral posture is used to define a muscle path. The objective of this study was to model curved muscle paths in the cervical spine that take into consideration soft tissue deformation with changes in neck posture. Two subject-specific models were created from magnetic resonance images (MRI) in 5 different sagittal plane neck postures. Curved paths of flexor and extensor muscles were modeled using piecewise linear lines-of-action in two ways; (1) using fixed via points determined from muscle paths in the neutral posture and (2) using moving muscle points that moved relative to the bones determined from muscle paths in all 5 postures. Accuracy of each curved modeled muscle path was evaluated by an error metric, the distance from the anatomic (centroid) muscle path determined from the MRI. Error metric was compared among three modeled muscle path types (straight, fixed via and moving muscle point) using a repeated measures one-way ANOVA (α=0.05). Moving muscle point paths had 21\% lower error metric than fixed via point paths over all 15 pairs of neck muscles examined over 5 postures (3.86mm vs. 4.88mm). This study highlights the importance of defining muscle paths in multiple postures in order to properly define the changing curvature of a muscle path due to soft tissue deformation with posture.},

The muscle origin and insertion differences between small and large cadavers is great, as would be expected, and the use of single specimen or average data will result in large errors in muscle force predictions.

	volume = {73},
	doi = {10.1016/j.medengphy.2019.07.010},
	abstract = {Background: 
The limitations of functional electrical stimulation (FES) cycling directly affect the health benefits acquired from this technology and prevents its' full potential to be realised. Experiments should be done on a test bed which can isolate and focus only on one muscle group, namely the quadriceps. The aim of this work was to design and develop an isokinetic robotic leg extension/flexion dynamometer which can mimic knee joint motion during actual cycling to be used for evaluation of novel functional electrical stimulation strategies. Although the main motivation for development of the dynamometer was for application in FES studies, it has the potential to be used for various different muscle physiology studies.

Methods:
A feedback control system with integrated electrical stimulation for isokinetic knee joint torque measurement has been developed and tested for safety and functionality. The leg extension/flexion device was modified and equipped with a DC motor drive system to imitate isokinetic knee joint motion during cycling when the hip joint remains fixed. Real-time bi-directional effective torque on the lever arm was measured by a magnetostrictive torque sensor and a load cell. Closed-loop motor control system was also designed to mimic the cyclical motion at desired angular velocity.

Results:
A functional model of the robotic dynamometer was developed and evaluated. The dynamometer is capable of simulating the knee angle during cycling at a cadence of up to 70 rpm with range of motion of 72∘. The magnetostrictive torque sensor can measure torque values up to 75 Nm. The lever arm can be adjusted and the target knee angle was controlled with RMSE tracking error of less than 2.1∘ in tests with and without a test person, and with and without muscle stimulation.

Conclusions:
The isokinetic knee joint torque measurement system was designed and validated in this work, and subsequently used to develop and evaluate novel muscle activation strategies. This is important for fundamental research on effective stimulation patterns and novel activation strategies. This will, in turn, enhance the efficiency of FES cycling exercise and has the potential to improve the health-beneficial effects.},

	abstract = {Impaired control of mediolateral body motion during walking is an important health concern. Developing treatments to improve mediolateral control is challenging, partly because the mechanisms by which muscles modulate mediolateral ground reaction force (and thereby modulate mediolateral acceleration of the body mass center) during unimpaired walking are poorly understood. To investigate this, we examined mediolateral ground reaction forces in eight unimpaired subjects walking at four speeds and determined the contributions of muscles, gravity, and velocity-related forces to the mediolateral ground reaction force by analyzing muscle-driven simulations of these subjects. During early stance (0–6\% gait cycle), peak ground reaction force on the leading foot was directed laterally and increased signiﬁcantly (p o0.05) with walking speed. During early single support (14–30\% gait cycle), peak ground reaction force on the stance foot was directed medially and increased signiﬁcantly (p o 0.01) with speed. Muscles accounted for more than 92\% of the mediolateral ground reaction force over all walking speeds, whereas gravity and velocity-related forces made relatively small contributions. Muscles coordinate mediolateral acceleration via an interplay between the medial ground reaction force contributed by the abductors and the lateral ground reaction forces contributed by the knee extensors, plantarﬂexors, and adductors. Our ﬁndings show how muscles that contribute to forward progression and body-weight support also modulate mediolateral acceleration of the body mass center while weight is transferred from one leg to another during double support.},

A technique for calculating muscle moment arms from muscle attachment points in a three-dimensional (3D) space has been established. This model accounts for the configuration of adjacent joints, a critical aspect of biarticular moment arm analysis that must be considered when calculating joint torque. Moment arm profiles from isolated muscle motions are compared to two existing models. The dependence of biarticular muscle\&rsquo;s moment arms on the configuration of the adjacent joint is a critical aspect of moment arm analysis that must be considered when calculating joint torque.
