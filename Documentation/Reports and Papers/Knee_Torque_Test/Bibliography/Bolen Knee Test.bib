	abstract = {A simple planar static model of the knee joint was developed to calculate effective moment arms for the quadriceps muscle. A pathway for the instantaneous center of rotation was chosen that gives realstic orientations of the femur relative to the tibia. Using the model, nonlinear force and moment equilibrium equations were solved at one degree increments for knee flexion angles from 0 (full extension) to 90°, yielding patellar orientation, patellofemoral contact force and patellar ligament force and direction with respect to both the tibial insertion point and the tibiofemoral contact point. The computer-derived results from this two-dimensional model agree with results from more complex models developed previously from experimentally obtained data. Due to our model's simplicity, however, the operation of the patellar mechanism as a lever as well as a spacer is clearly illustrated. Specifically, the thickness of the patella was found to increase the effective moment arm significantly only at flexions below 35° even though the actual moment arm exhibited an increase throughout the flexion range. Lengthening either the patella or the patellar ligament altered the force transmitted from the quadriceps to the patellar ligament, significantly increasing the effective moment arm at flexions greater than 25°. We conclude that the levering action of the patella is an essential mechanism of knee joint operation at moderate to high flexion angles.},

	abstract = {The generation of muscle-actuated simulations that accurately represent the movement of old adults requires a model that accounts for changes in muscle properties that occur with aging. An objective of this study was to adjust the parameters of Hill-type musculo-tendon models to reflect nominal age-related changes in muscle mechanics that have been reported in the literature. A second objective was to determine whether using the parametric adjustments resulted in simulated dynamic ankle torque behavior similar to that seen in healthy old adults. The primary parameter adjustment involved decreasing maximum isometric muscle forces to account for the loss of muscle mass and specific strength with age. A review of the literature suggested the need for other modest adjustments that account for prolonged muscular deactivation, a reduction in maximum contraction velocity, greater passive muscle stiffness and increased normalized force capacity during lengthening contractions. With age-related changes incorporated, a musculo-tendon model was used to simulate isometric and isokinetic contractions of ankle plantarflexor and dorsiflexor muscles. The model predicted that ankle plantarflexion power output during 120 deg/s shortening contractions would be over 40\% lower in old adults compared to healthy young adults. These power losses with age exceed the 30\% loss in isometric strength assumed in the model but are comparable to 39–44\% reductions in ankle power outputs measured in healthy old adults of approximately 70 years of age. Thus, accounting for age-related changes in muscle properties, other than decreased maximum isometric force, may be particularly important when simulating movements that require substantial power development.},

	abstract = {As a strategy to address the difﬁculties encountered when modeling and controlling a musculoskeletal system, we present a straightforward implementation of an autonomous decentralized motion control system in this paper; the system is inspired by the spinal reﬂex system of animals. We developed an artiﬁcial receptor, a muscle, and a neuron to mechanically implement the reﬂex mechanisms of animals. Among the reﬂex mechanisms, this paper presents a reﬂex system with reciprocal innervation for a musculoskeletal quasi-quadruped robot, including antagonist muscles. In the experiments, the robot autonomously generated a leg trajectory and a gait pattern with smooth alternating motions of the antagonist muscles through the interaction between the body, the ground, and the artiﬁcial reﬂex systems. To evaluate the reciprocal innervation, we compared the developed robot with one that does not include antagonist muscles. The reciprocal innervation allows for twice as many muscle implementations as those offered by the robot without antagonist muscles. Moreover, it improves the running speed by 5\% on average and the ﬂexion and extension velocities of all joints by 28\% on average at around touchdowns and liftoffs of the foot. This successful result lead to implement more advanced nervous systems by solely mechanical devices.},

As a musculoskeletal system naturally possesses superiorities of flexibility and robustness, realizing human-like manipulation with the musculoskeletal system is investigated in this paper. However, the redundancy, coupling and strong nonlinearity of musculoskeletal system will bring many challenges for control. Therefore, based on strategies of human manipulation and muscle coordination, a biologically inspired control scheme is proposed. First, we apply a strategy based on attractive region in environment to plan the manipulation under environmental constraints in the task space. Then, we extract muscle synergies as movement primitives and design an iterative learning controller to coordinate these synergies to accomplish complex manipulation. The muscle synergy based iterative learning controller can overcome the difficulty of constructing an explicit model of the sophisticated musculoskeletal system and improve motion learning by transforming the high dimensional muscle excitation into a lower dimensional space. With the combination of strategy based on attractive region in environment and muscle synergy based controller, we preliminarily realize human-like manipulation with high precision, flexibility and robustness. The effectiveness of our control scheme is verified in a peg-in-hole assembly task.},

	abstract = {In a musculoskeletal system, internal tensile forces are generated among the muscles because it is a redundant system. The balancing of the internal tensile forces for a given posture generates a potential field in the system. Therefore, the potential field is utilized for the sensorless feedforward position control and improvement of stability based on the feedback method. However, the stability of the internal tensile forces is strongly influenced by the muscular arrangement. Previous studies showed that a stable condition can be identified through the minimization of the potential at a desired posture, and the sufficient condition has been theoretically established; however, the geometric condition of the muscular arrangement has not been determined. To effectively exploit the characteristics of the internal tensile forces, the geometric condition must be elucidated in the design of a musculoskeletal system. This paper aims to clarify the geometric condition to generate stable internal tensile forces. Based on the conditions generating the potential that is minimum at the desired posture, the paper analyzes that the geometric condition on a musculoskeletal structure with two-link and six-muscle. Additionally, the identified condition is assessed based on simulations. As a result, we revealed the geometric condition of the muscular arrangement to generate stable internal tensile forces. By designing the muscular arrangement to satisfy the condition, the stability of the internal tensile forces is ensured, and consequently, a control method utilizing the characteristics of the internal tensile force is stably implemented.},

Scientists have identified the pathways of reflexes; however, it is difficult to investigate their effects during locomotion because locomotion is controlled by a complex neural system and current technology does not allow us to change the control pathways in living humans. To understand these effects, we construct a musculoskeletal bipedal robot, which has similar body structure and dynamics to those of a human. By conducting experiments on this robot, we investigate the effects of reflexes (stretch reflex and crossed inhibitory response) on posture during hopping, a simple and representative bouncing gait with complex dynamics. Through over 300 hopping trials, we confirm that both the stretch reflex and crossed response can contribute to reducing the lateral inclination during hopping. These reflexive pathways do not use any prior knowledge of the dynamic information of the body such as its inclination. Beyond improving the understanding of the human neural system, this study provides roboticists with biomimetic ideas for robot locomotion control.},

The purpose of this robot is to achieve motions and characteristics that are very similar to a human body.

Using a bundle of thin McKibben muscles, we develop a multifilament muscle that has characteristics similar to those of human muscles. In contrast, the actuators of conventional musculoskeletal robots are very heavy, not densely attached and have poor backdrivability. Because multifilament muscles are light and can be densely attached, we can attach them to the musculoskeletal robot as skeletal muscle and achieve a redundant system that is equivalent to a human drive mechanism. In this paper, we report a method for fabricating multifilament muscles that imitate various muscles, the development of a lower-limb muscle mechanism for the redundant musculoskeletal robot with thin McKibben muscles and experimental results showing that the proposed musculoskeletal robot achieves humanlike motions that have not yet been reported for other robots.},

	abstract = {Biomechanics researchers often use multibody models to represent biological systems. However, the mapping from biology to mechanics and back can be problematic. OpenSim is a popular open source tool used for this purpose, mapping between biological specifications and an underlying generalized coordinate multibody system called Simbody. One quantity of interest to biomechanical researchers and clinicians is “muscle moment arm,” a measure of the effectiveness of a muscle at contributing to a particular motion over a range of configurations. OpenSim can automatically calculate these quantities for any muscle once a model has been built. For simple cases, this calculation is the same as the conventional moment arm calculation in mechanical engineering. But a muscle may span several joints (e.g., wrist, neck, back) and may follow a convoluted path over various curved surfaces. A biological joint may require several bodies or even a mechanism to accurately represent in the multibody model (e.g., knee, shoulder). In these situations we need a careful definition of muscle moment arm that is analogous to the mechanical engineering concept, yet generalized to be of use to biomedical researchers. Here we present some biomechanical modeling challenges and how they are resolved in OpenSim and Simbody to yield biologically meaningful muscle moment arms.},

	abstract = {private, nonprofit organization of scientists, dedicated to the furtherance of science and to its use for the general welfare. The Academy was established in 1863 under a Congressional char-ter signed by President Lincoln. Empowered to provide for all activi-ties appropriate to academies of science, it was also required by its charter to act as an adviser to the Federal Government in scientific matters. Thb provision accounts for the close ties that have always existed between the Academy and the Government, although the Acad-emy is not a governmental agency. The National Research Council was established by the Academy in 1916, at the request of President Wilson, to enable scientists generally to associate their efforts with those of the limited membership of the Acad-emy in service to the nation, to society, and to science at home and abroad. Members of the National Research Council receive their appoint-ments from the President of the Academy. They include representatives nominated by the major scientific and technical societies, representatives of the Federal Government, and a number of members-at-large. In addi-tion, several thousand scientists and engineers take part in the activities of the Research Council through membership on its various boards and committees. Receiving funds from both public and private sources, by contribution, grant, or contract, the Academy and its Research Council thus work to stimulate research and its applications, to survey the broad possibilities of science, to promote effective utilization of the scientific and technical resources of the country, to serve the Government, and to further the general interests of science.},

These equations allow one to find, at a low computational cost, the musculotendon geometric parameters required for numerical simulation of large musculoskeletal models. Nominal values for these biomechanical parameters were established using a public-domain musculoskeletal model of the lower limb (IEEE Trans. Biomed. Eng. 37 (1990) 757). To fit these nominal values, regression equations with different levels of complexity were generated, based on the number of generalized coordinates of the joints spanned by each musculotendon actuator. Least squares fitting was used to identify regression equation coefficients. The goodness of the fit and confidence intervals were assessed, and the best fitting equations selected.},

	abstract = {In musculoskeletal modeling, reliable estimates of muscle moment arms are an important step in accurately predicting muscle forces and joint moments. The degree of agreement between the two common methods of calculating moment arms—tendon excursion (TE) and geometric origin–insertion, is currently unknown for the muscles crossing the knee joint. Further, measured moment arm data are subject to variability in estimation of attachment sites as points from irregular surfaces on the bones, and due to differences in joint kinematics observed in vivo. Thus, the objectives of the present study were to compare moment arms of major muscles crossing the knee joint obtained from TE and geometric methods using a finite element-based lower extremity model, and to quantify the effects of potential muscle origin–insertion and tibiofemoral kinematic variability on the predicted moment arms using probabilistic methods. A semiconstrained, fixed bearing, posterior cruciate-retaining total knee arthroplasty was included due to available in vivo kinematic data. In this study, muscle origin and insertion locations and kinematic variables were represented as normal distributions with standard deviations of 5 mm for origin–insertion locations and up to 1.6 mm and 3.0° for the kinematic parameters. Agreement between the deterministic moment arm calculations from the two methods was excellent for the flexors, while differences in trends and magnitudes were observed for the extensor muscles. Model-predicted deterministic moment arms from both methods agreed reasonably with the experimental values from available literature. The uncertainty in input parameters resulted in substantial variability in predicted moment arms, with the size of 1–99\% confidence interval being up to 41.3 and 35.8 mm for the TE and geometric methods, respectively. The sizeable range of moment arm predictions and associated excursions has the potential to affect a muscle’s operating range on the force–length curve, thus affecting joint moments. In this study, moment arm predictions were more dependent on muscle origin–insertion locations than the kinematic variables. The important parameters from the TE method were the origin and insertion locations in the sagittal plane, while the insertion location in the sagittal plane was the dominant parameter using the geometric method.},
