In silico (computer simulation) evaluation of an Animatlab controller to coordinate sagittal plane walking gait in a 14 DoF rat model.

Context:

Legged robots locomotion not as good as animals.
Neurobiology theory: hierarchies in the CNS sub-divide complex tasks into subtasks. Brain at the top, motoneurons at the bottom, and each level relies on level-appropriate sensory information to act on the levels below.
Neurological measurement experiments suggest hypothetical circuits.
Non-detailed evidence of CPGs in mammalian systems has resulted in manymodeling theories.
This paper expands upon a state controller for tetrapod hind leg stepping by implementing it in a neurologically based CPG controller.

similar to the one produced by Szczecinski [reference 10].



Correctness:

Generally correct and not a bad match. Hard to quantify error.
Tests done without fully supporting body weight (although this is similar to how tests are done on in vivo animals).
Brains and neural circuitry are very complex, with tens of thousands of connections, highly nonlinear, and involve many parallel processes. Occam's razor does not always hold in these circumstances.

Contributions:

Modeling theories can be tested in Animatlab
In silico ablation tests can be performed.

This can reduce the or eliminate the need to perform these experiments on living animals.
Models can give insight into what/where we should look for future experiments.



Summary:

Biologically inspired controller, based on theoretical neurological circuits, for rat model is simulated. Produces a decent gait match between output and actual animal models.

This paper both describes a measurement of the properties of a BPA, and also offers a prototype of a artificial muscle system that is more biologically inspired.


Context

This paper is heavily based off of the McKibben paper that describes the construction of a BPA, as well as the Hill paper which describes an equation to compute muscle properties. With the Hill model, the authors also compile a list of animal muscle properties to provide a range of coefficients that their experimental set up will try to achieve. While trying to create a damping system to make a more biologically realistic muscle system, they derive orifice size based off of Bernoulli's equation.


Correctness

The experimental procedure isn't described particularly well, so verifying     . During orifice calculation, some leaps in logic make it difficult to foll


Contributions

 


Clarity

This paper was easy to follow, however, some of the jumps in calculations for the orifice sizing was not described well. Having all the figures and tables listed at the back of the paper was frustrating, as one has to flip pages often to view figures that are being described in the text.

	url = {https://asme.pinetec.com/detc2017/data/pdfs/trk-8/DETC2017-67458.pdf},
	abstract = {Braided pneumatic actuators (BPAs) are attractive for use in
bio-robots because they offer many muscle-like properties,
especially when compared to most other commercially available
robotic actuators. Unfortunately, the same properties that make
these actuators similar to muscles make them more difficult to
control. One such actuator manufactured by Festo, the MXAM-
10-AA, is frequently utilized in robotics because of its
commercial availability, durability, and force capability.
Although models for BPAs exist, the properties that make this
actuator more durable also make its behavior less like other
braided pneumatic actuators, especially for shorter actuator
lengths. Length specific models that do exist for Festo fluidic
muscles have numerous parameters that can only be found
experimentally by taking hundreds to thousands of data points
and performing a lengthy optimization process to fit parameter
values for each actuator in the system. This lack of
generalizability makes it difficult to build a new robot and begin
testing new control systems without significant startup time and
cost. The key contribution of this work is the development of a
generalizable actuator model that accounts for the geometry and
limitations of the actuator at shorter lengths. This empirical
model relates internal pressure, strain, stretching or contracting
state, and applied force on the MXAM-10-AA actuator. The
model is scalable to different length actuators by measuring their
resting length at zero pressure and their minimum contraction
length at maximum air pressure, and can be used for feedforward
length control. The model is evaluated on a robot leg with three
joints and 6 actuators, each with different length. The developed
controller, using the actuator model, controls the joints to within
± 3 degrees of the desired position for different desired torques
only using internal actuator pressure feedback. We also
demonstrate control speed by cycling a joint over 40 degrees of
rotation at varying frequencies.},

 This paper derives a generalized model for calculating the pressure needed in a 10 mm Festa BPA to generate a specific force and strain at the end effector. The model requires knowledge of the strain and force at maximum pressure (620 kPa). The paper continues to evaluate this model's effectiveness on a robot in which two antagonistic muscles are controlling joint angle.


Context

 This paper


Correctness

 The assumptions appear to be valid. One of the areas that could improve the results of the paper is removal of the use of kinked muscles on the robot. In a few spots, the author describes that due to the kinking, pressure filling in the muscle doesn't result in a change in length. Using unkinked muscles could improve the results and strengthen the conclusions. 


Contributions

 The main contribution of this paper is the model that is described above. The hope is that given a 10 mm Festo BPA, a user only needs to measure two parameters in order to have a functional model that will provide them pressure needed in the BPA in order to achieve a desired strain and force. It also describes how the model can be used in conjuction with a robot and bang bang controller to control a compliant robotic joint.


Clarity

The paper is well written, however, it almost feels like two papers in one. The first being a description of how the model was generated. The second paper being an implementation of the model on a controller for a robot.

	abstract = {Several factors affect the performance of humanoid walking. One factor is the complex nature of lower limbs, especially the muscles around the pelvis that contribute significantly to the stability and adaptivity of humanoid locomotion. The significance of this muscle group assures a impact on the facility of walking robots once the nature of its contribution is understood, and it can be replicated on robots. To propose a mechanical structure that facilitates walking in robots, we realized a muscle by modeling its pelvis region like that of a humanoid and developing a musculoskeletal humanoid robot. Especially, we focused on the gluteus medius, which is important for the general stability against frontal movements of the hip. Furthermore, it passively changes its influence on such motions; this is helpful during the different phases of locomotion. These changes depend on the alignment of the pelvis and femur. We confirmed the viability of the robotic gluteus medius, which was simplified to a model of two partial muscles by accomplishing the walking using this robot. This accomplishment verifies our hypothesis that using this model, the supporting functionality for the locomotion of the muscle can be reproduced and enhances the biological plausibility.},

	abstract = {This paper presents a method of designing a more human-like walking pattern for a bipedal humanoid robot. Motivated by biomechanical studies on human walking, we model the walking pattern with continuous and differentiable mathematical functions. For dynamic balance of the robot, we design a pattern generator based on the ZMP (Zero-Moment Point) criterion. In comparison to the conventional bent-knee walking pattern, the proposed walking pattern involves three-dimensional motion of the upper body. With the proposed walking pattern the robot can walk with almost stretched knees at low and medium walking speeds. This paper also presents a body posture control method. The controller is based on sensory feedback and modifies the reference walking pattern in real time in order to stabilize the robot. We have implemented the proposed walking pattern and control method on the humanoid robot NAO. Walking experiments have verified that the proposed scheme improves the dynamic balance of the robot. Besides, we have investigated the energy consumption at the knee joint actuators and the overall energy consumption at all the joints of both legs, by using NAO that fulfills the conventional walking pattern and the proposed walking pattern respectively. Experiments have proved that (i) knee-stretched motion can improve the walking efficiency of a humanoid robot; and (ii) the proposed walking pattern is more efficient.},

	abstract = {This paper presents the methodology used to achieve efﬁcient and dynamic walking behaviors on the prototype humanoid robotics platform, DURUS. As a means of providing a hardware platform capable of these behaviors, the design of DURUS combines highly efﬁcient electromechanical components with “control in the loop” design of the leg morphology. Utilizing the ﬁnal design of DURUS, a formal framework for the generation of dynamic walking gaits which maximizes efﬁciency by exploiting the full body dynamics of the robot, including the interplay between the passive and active elements, is developed. The gaits generated through this methodology form the basis of the control implementation experimentally realized on DURUS; in particular, the trajectories generated through the formal framework yield a feedforward control input which is modulated by feedback in the form of regulators that compensate for discrepancies between the model and physical system. The end result of the uniﬁed approach to control-informed mechanical design, formal gait design and regulator-based feedback control implementation is efﬁcient and dynamic locomotion on the humanoid robot DURUS. In particular, DURUS was able to demonstrate dynamic locomotion at the DRC Finals Endurance Test, walking for just under ﬁve hours in a single day, traveling 3.9 km with a mean cost of transport of 1.61—the lowest reported cost of transport achieved on a bipedal humanoid robot.},

In this paper, a jumping robot driven by pneumatic artiﬁcial muscles is designed to duplicate human leg structure and function. It has three joints and nine muscles, three of them are biarticular muscles. For controlling such a redundant robot, we take biomechanical ﬁndings into account: biarticular muscles mainly contribute to joint coordination whereas monoarticular muscles contribute to provide power. Through experiments, we ﬁnd (1) the biarticular muscles realize coordinated movement of joints when knee and/or hip is extended, (2) the extension of the ankle does not lead to coordinated movement, and (3) we can superpose extension of the knee with that of the hip without losing the joint coordination. The obtained knowledge can be used not only for robots, but may also contribute to understanding of adaptive human mechanism.},

	abstract = {Despite all the effort devoted to generating locomotion algorithms for bipedal walkers, robots are still far from reaching the impressive human walking capabilities, for instance regarding robustness and energy consumption. In this paper, we have developed a bio-inspired torque-based controller supporting the emergence of a new generation of robust and energy-efficient walkers. It recruits virtual muscles driven by reflexes and a central pattern generator, and thus requires no computationally intensive inverse kinematics or dynamics modeling. This controller is capable of generating energy-efficient and human-like gaits (both regarding kinematics and dynamics) across a large range of forward speeds, in a 3D environment. After a single off-line optimization process, the forward speed can be continuously commanded within this range by changing high-level parameters, as linear or quadratic functions of the target speed. Sharp speed transitions can then be achieved with no additional tuning, resulting in immediate adaptations of the step length and frequency. In this paper, we particularly embodied this controller on a simulated version of COMAN, a 95 cm tall humanoid robot. We reached forward speed modulations between 0.4 and 0.9 m/s. This covers normal human walking speeds once scaled to the robot size. Finally, the walker demonstrated significant robustness against a large spectrum of unpredicted perturbations: facing external pushes or walking on altered environments, such as stairs, slopes, and irregular ground.},

Development and modeling of a bio-inspired CPG controller for a bipedal robot's forward locomotion. Model is energy and computationally efficient. Controller incorporates reflexes and feedback to achieve human-like gait. Virtual Hill-type muscles used in the controller.

Context:

Humanoid bipedal robots are potentially well-adapted to our world.
Robots are far from reaching high fidelity human walking capabilities.
Zero-moment point (ZMP) method of robot locomotion analyzed, and pitfalls discussed. E.g. energy inefficiency and unnatural gait.
Other locomotion concepts looked at:

Inverted Pendulum Model (IPM).
Linear Inverted Pendulum (LPM).
Limit cycle walking.


Two papers, Geyer and Herr (2010), and Song and Geyer (2015), developed bipedal models being actuated by a human-like neuromuscular model.

Part of model adapted by Eilenberg et al. (2010) to control a powered ankle-foot prosthetic device.


Previous Van der Noot paper (2015a) brought this controller to a real humanoid robot.
Central Pattern Generator (CPG). CPGs are neural circuits can make rhythmic patternsof neural activity without receiving rhythmic inputs. Properties:

distributed control
redundancies handling
locomotion modulation using simple control signals



Correctness:

This seems correct.

Contributions:

Controller adaptable to other humanoid robots.
Combines a CPG and reflexes in a neuromuscular torque based controller for bipedal locomotion.
Shows the successive increments performed while designing this CPG network, in order to generate the stimulation patterns governing different walking features.
Control schematic in Figure 1 can be adapted with some modification for our robot that uses Festo artificial muscles.
Simulations of different walking parameters shown in their Youtube videos.
Hill-type muscle actuated bipedal robot is feasible.

Summary:

This paper is very well put together, if long. They evaluate some of the existing controllers for bipedal robot locomotion and make a strong case for combining CPG and reflexes in a neuromuscular torque base controller. Model is shown to be energy-efficient. Gait is robust and COMAN (robot) can handle getting hit by balls, uneven ground, and stairs. Better match to human gait than Linear Inverted Pendulum (LIP) model. Has the potential to match human gait better with modified muscle placement, more muscles, and more degrees of freedom.

This work describes the process of designing artificial muscle attachment locations of the legs of a bipedal robot utilizing pneumatic artificial muscles (PAMs). PAMs offer similar force and activation times to real muscles, while being lightweight and low power. However, not all properties are identical, and substituting artificial muscles in with the same attachment locations results in different torque profiles about each joint. This work analyzes muscle length, moment arm, and isometric force of muscles over a range of different joint configurations, based on muscle attachment and wrapping points of the Gait2392 model in OpenSim. These parameters are then used to find joint torques produced by each muscle. This process is repeated for a model of the robot actuated by PAMs. Joint torques for individual muscles and groups of muscles are then compared between the models. Results indicate that several muscles torque profiles in the robot model closely match that of the human model, however, many muscles fall far short of the human capabilities. Where appropriate, additional results demonstrate how muscle attachment locations on the robot have been modified to better match the torque capabilities demonstrated by the OpenSim model. Matlab tools created for this project will facilitate further design refinement before implementation on the robot.},

The discovery of central motor programs has provided crucial insight into the logic of one prototypic set of neural circuits: those that generate motor patterns.

In the animal, two types of responses to perturbations are observed: resetting and non-resetting deletions. This suggests that the animal locomotor system contains a memory-like organization. To model this phenomenon, we built a synthetic nervous system that uses separate rhythm generator and pattern formation layers to activate antagonistic muscle pairs about each joint in the sagittal plane. Our model replicates the resetting and non-resetting deletions observed in the animal. In addition, in the intact (i.e., fully afferented) rat walking simulation, we observe slower recovery after perturbation, which is different from the deafferented animal experiment. These results demonstrate that our model is a biologically feasible description of some of the neural circuits in the mammalian spinal cord that control locomotion, and the difference between our simulation and ﬁctive motion shows the importance of sensory feedback on motor output. This model also demonstrates how the pattern formation network can activate muscle synergies in a coordinated way to produce stable walking, which motivates the use of more complex synergies activating more muscles in the legs for three-dimensional limb motion.},

	abstract = {Dynamic simulations of movement allow one to study neuromuscular coordination, analyze athletic performance, and estimate internal loading of the musculoskeletal system. Simulations can also be used to identify the sources of pathological movement and establish a scientiﬁc basis for treatment planning. We have developed a freely available, open-source software system (OpenSim) that lets users develop models of musculoskeletal structures and create dynamic simulations of a wide variety of movements. We are using this system to simulate the dynamics of individuals with pathological gait and to explore the biomechanical effects of treatments. OpenSim provides a platform on which the biomechanics community can build a library of simulations that can be exchanged, tested, analyzed, and improved through a multi-institutional collaboration. Developing software that enables a concerted effort from many investigators poses technical and sociological challenges. Meeting those challenges will accelerate the discovery of principles that govern movement control and improve treatments for individuals with movement pathologies.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Pneumatic artiﬁcial muscles are quite promising actuators for humanoid robots owing to their similar characteristics with human muscles. Moreover, biologically inspired musculoskeletal systems are particularly important for humanoid robots to perform versatile dynamic tasks.
OBJECTIVE: This study aims to develop a pneumatic musculoskeletal biped robot, and its controller, to realize human-like walking.
METHODS: According to the simpliﬁed musculoskeletal structure of human lower limbs, each leg of the biped robot is driven by nine muscles, including three pairs of monoarticular muscles which are arranged in the ﬂexor-extensor form, as well as three biarticular muscles which span two joints. To lower cost, high-speed on/off solenoid valves rather than proportional valves are used to control the muscles. The joint trajectory tracking controller based on PID control method is designed to achieve the desired motion. Considering the complex characteristics of pneumatic artiﬁcial muscles, the control model is obtained through parameter identiﬁcation experiments.
RESULTS: Preliminary experimental results demonstrate that the biped robot is able to walk with this control strategy.
CONCLUSION: The proposed musculoskeletal structure and control strategy are effective for the biped robot to achieve human-like walking.},

	abstract = {Walking is the most common terrestrial form of locomotion in animals. Its great versatility and flexibility has led to many attempts at building walking machines with similar capabilities. The control of walking is an active research area both in neurobiology and robotics, with a large and growing body of work. This paper gives an overview of the current knowledge on the control of legged locomotion in animals and machines and attempts to give walking control researchers from biology and robotics an overview of the current knowledge in both fields. We try to summarize the knowledge on the neurobiological basis of walking control in animals, emphasizing common principles seen in different species. In a section on walking robots, we review common approaches to walking controller design with a slight emphasis on biped walking control. We show where parallels between robotic and neurobiological walking controllers exist and how robotics and biology may benefit from each other. Finally, we discuss where research in the two fields diverges and suggest ways to bridge these gaps.},
