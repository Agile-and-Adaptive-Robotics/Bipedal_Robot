# Bipedal Robot
The bipedal robot is a cross disciplinary project being worked on in the Agile and Adaptive Robotics lab by PhD, Masters, and Undergraduate Students. The aim is to develop a robot, actuated by pneumatic artificial muscles, that is able to walk.

## Current Objectives
1. Create a Matlab script to optimize PAM placement to replicate human torque profile about joints.
2. Design lower body skeletal structure that has the range of motion of a human skeletal structure.

## Future Objective
1. Print and assemble lower body of the bipedal robot.
2. Perform experiments to verify the torque profiles about joints.
3. Develop a sequence of actuation that can generate sagittal plane walking motion.
4. Create a neural controller that can integrate sensory information to generate robust walking.

## Software
SolidWorks - Tools for creating the model of the lower body, to be printed on Markforge 3D printers.

OpenSim - Used to display biologically realistic muscle placements on human.

Matlab - For creating scripts for torque calculation and muscle placement optimization.
